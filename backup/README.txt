This folder should contain backup copies of your important files for the job checker system.

Recommended files to keep here:
- checker.py (your main script)
- recipients.json (your email recipients list)
- .env (your environment variables)

To restore your system to a working state, use the restore_backup.bat script in the main folder.

To update your backup, copy the latest working versions of these files into this folder, overwriting the old ones.
